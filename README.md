# Free Speech: A Social Media Platform 

"Free Speech" is a lightweight, modern social media application inspired by platforms like Instagram. This project was built as an educational tool to understand and implement the core functionalities of a visual-content-based social platform, from user authentication to interactive feeds.

## ‚ú® About The Project

[cite_start]While major social media platforms are powerful, their closed-source and complex nature makes it difficult for developers to learn how they work[cite: 29]. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a simplified, functional clone that demonstrates key features using a modern tech stack.

[cite_start]The application allows users to register, create posts with images or videos, and interact with other users through likes, comments, and a follow system[cite: 36, 37, 39]. [cite_start]The user feed is personalized and features infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience[cite: 40, 41].

## ÁöÑÊ†∏ÂøÉÂäüËÉΩ (Core Features)
