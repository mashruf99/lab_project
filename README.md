# Free Speech: A Social Media Platform 

"Free Speech" is a lightweight, modern social media application inspired by platforms like Instagram. This project was built as an educational tool to understand and implement the core functionalities of a visual-content-based social platform, from user authentication to interactive feeds.

##  About The Project

While major social media platforms are powerful, their closed-source and complex nature makes it difficult for developers to learn how they work. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a simplified, functional clone that demonstrates key features using a modern tech stack.

The application allows users to register, create posts with images or videos, and interact with other users through likes, comments, and a follow system. The user feed is personalized and features infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience.

## Core Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, log-in, and session management powered by Appwrite.
* **Profile Management**: Users can create and edit their profiles, including updating their bio and profile picture.
* **Content Posting**: Create posts with captions, requiring an image or video upload.
* **Personalized Feed**: The home feed displays the latest posts from users you follow.
* **User Interaction**: Like posts, leave comments, and follow or unfollow other users to customize your feed.
* **Infinite Scrolling**: The feed automatically loads more posts as you scroll down, ensuring a smooth user experience.
* **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
