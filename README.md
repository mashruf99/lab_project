# Free Speech: A Social Media Platform 

"Free Speech" is a lightweight, modern social media application inspired by platforms like Instagram. This project was built as an educational tool to understand and implement the core functionalities of a visual-content-based social platform, from user authentication to interactive feeds.

##  About The Project

While major social media platforms are powerful, their closed-source and complex nature makes it difficult for developers to learn how they work[cite: 29]. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a simplified, functional clone that demonstrates key features using a modern tech stack.

The application allows users to register, create posts with images or videos, and interact with other users through likes, comments, and a follow system[cite: 36, 37, 39]. The user feed is personalized and features infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience[cite: 40, 41].

## ÁöÑÊ†∏ÂøÉÂäüËÉΩ (Core Features)

* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, log-in, and session management powered by Appwrite[cite: 82].
* **Profile Management**: Users can create and edit their profiles, including updating their bio and profile picture[cite: 83].
* **Content Posting**: Create posts with captions, requiring an image or video upload[cite: 84].
* **Personalized Feed**: The home feed displays the latest posts from users you follow[cite: 85].
* **User Interaction**: Like posts, leave comments, and follow or unfollow other users to customize your feed[cite: 86, 87].
* **Infinite Scrolling**: The feed automatically loads more posts as you scroll down, ensuring a smooth user experience[cite: 87].
* **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui[cite: 88].
